# Welcome

This is a collection of SQL scripts. They help me get work done from time to time, and I've made them public domain because I hope they can help you too. There's nothing special about them; I wanted a repo for better tracking.

**Please note:** these scripts were written for MS SQL Server. I don't guarantee they will work against Oracle, MySQL, Postgres, or even older versions of the SQL Server product.

## Warning

Don't run scripts from the internet in your production environment. Including these.

Seriously, I'm not liable for any fuck-ups caused to your database if you choose to use a script from this repo.

While I'll do my best to explain what a script is doing and maybe even warn against potential pitfalls, I'm human and can't catch/think of every circumstance.
